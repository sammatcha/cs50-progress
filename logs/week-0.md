## Notes
Algorithms : step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem

Artificial Intelligence
- AI programmers train large language models (LLMs) on large datasets
- look at patterns in large blocks of language


## Assignment (Scratch)

<u>Premise of project</u>
<br> Select a character and collect the loot on all different stages while avoiding the opposing character.

<br> - Things I had issues were with certain things acting buggy and I debugged the problem using the variables I created.

<br> - Its easy to break longer blocks to smaller blocks - it helps debug this way as well.

<br> - It also helped to make blocks because once more complexities got introduced, the given blocks were not enough.
